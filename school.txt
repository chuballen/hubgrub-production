 Calculating Grade:
The grade will be a weighted average of scores between 0 and 4 as follows: 30% Long HW + 30% Midterm + 5% Short HW + 35% Final Project. This average is then converted to a letter grade A = 4.0, A- = 3.7, B+ =3.3, B =3.0, ... F = 0. See the introductory slides for details.

 Deleted files still showing in the directory (W10)

Hi,

I recently noticed that when I was deleting a file, either in the Desktop or any other directories, the deleted file is still showing. If I try to "open" a deleted file, it says file doesn't exist... and after a few seconds or retries, the file eventually disappears from the display but it can take 5 to 10 seconds!

The same happen when renaming a file. After the rename action, the file is still displaying its previous name...

I found a quite identical subject in the forum (unfortunately, not solved) and ran sfc to check my system but it says that nothing is corrupt (good in a certain way!).

Any idea to fix this annoying behavior?

Running under W10 Home v1709 (16299.371) French

I7-4510U @2.60GHz and 8GB RAM (so I don't think it's a System lag ?)

Thanks in advance!
